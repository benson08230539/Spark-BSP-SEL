## Prerequisites

```
All experiments in this paper are conducted on a Spark distributed cluster. The specific cluster configuration is: Spark distributed cluster has 32 host nodes, of which 24 hosts have two 16Cores, 2.6GHZ Intel Xeon E5-2650 CPUs, and 128GB of memory, while its 8 hosts have two 12Cores, 2.6GHZ Intel Xeon E5-2630 CPUs, and 128GB of memory. CPUs, and 128GB of RAM, and each host node has 30TB of hard drive capacity.
