# SEL Apps

## Explain

1.mllibCode folder is the Non-BSP and Non Ensemble but distributed code.(baseline)

2.utils folder is the tool kit.It can automatically adapt Windows system and Linux system.

3.bspMachineLearning folder is the SEL Apps using Spark-BSP-SEL code.

## SEL Non-MapReduce Paradigm using Smile's Serial algorithm.

Statistical Machine Intelligence & Learning Engine:`https://github.com/haifengl/smile` 

The BSP data model generation and sub-model modeling of this method adopt the distributed parallel computing of non-MapReduce computing paradigm, and the calculation of each data block is completed independently, which reduces the data communication between computing nodes and greatly improves the computing efficiency.
